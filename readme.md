# DeskAlert
DeskAlert is small Python program I wrote to work with the GoBright desk booking software. 

It enables you to receive an alert when a desk becomes available at your office.

It is a work-in-progress, and the code is a little sloppy because it's something I only have a short term need for.

Currently, it requires a Selenium browser pop-up to perform the initial authentication.
This unfortunately is the only option without admin access to your GoBright tenant.
